# Likely Likes

A browser plugin to help you get the most likes out of your Facebook posts. It presents you with your friends’ reactions as you type (subtly posing the question whether we really want our conversations to be this trivial).

## Installation

In its current form, the code is written as a Userscript to be run inside the Greasemonkey Firefox extension. Plans for future releases include the port to other browsers’ Userscript implementations and/or more convenient install methods e.g. as a standalone Firefox/Chrome extension.

So in order to use it

1.  Install the [Greasemonkey Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
2.  Grab the latest version of the [Likely Likes Userscript](https://github.com/schwarzben/instabook/raw/master/instabook.user.js)
3.  Greasemonkey should now ask you whether you want to install this script or not (guess what to choose …) so *you’re probably done!*

## Open wishlist

*   Convert to Firefox + Chrome extension
*   Support other languages  
    (currently the most active branch is in German, closely followed by the English version)
